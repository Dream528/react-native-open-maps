> üó∫ A simple cross-platform library to help perform map actions to the corresponding device's map (Google, Apple, or Yandex Maps)

`react-native-open-maps` works by creating a deep link for either Apple, Google, and Yandex maps that can be used to open up the relevant map application. In order to maximize compatibility some platform specific parameters are omitted, but simplifies development efforts and ensures a smooth user experience.

**Features**
- ‚úÖ Open the map coordinates immediately
- ‚úÖ Create a delayed invoked `function` that will open the map
- ‚úÖ Create a `string` of the map link
- Cross-compatible properties among different map applications

## Usage
1. Install the repository
    ```bash
    $ npm install --save react-native-open-maps
    ```
2. Add an import to the top of your file
    ```js
    import openMap from 'react-native-open-maps';
    ```
3. Put it all together
    ```js
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import { Button } from 'react-native';
    import openMap from 'react-native-open-maps';

    export default class App extends Component {
      _goToYosemite() {
        openMap({ latitude: 37.865101, longitude: -119.538330 });
      }

      render() {
        return (
          <Button
            color={'#bdc3c7'}
            onPress={this._goToYosemite}
            title="Click To Open Maps üó∫" />
        );
      }
    }
    ```
4. **BONUS:** You can also create delayed functions for more of that `1 - 1` mapping flavor üç¶.
```js
import { createOpenLink } from 'react-native-open-maps';

const yosemite = { latitude: 37.865101, longitude: -119.538330 };
const openYosemite = createOpenLink(yosemite);
const openYosemiteZoomedOut = createOpenLink({ ...yosemite, zoom: 30 });

const facebookHQ = { latitude: 37.4847, longitude: 122.1477 };
const openFacebookHQ = createOpenLink(facebookHQ);

// Condensed for Readability...
    render() {
        return (
          <Button
            color={'#bdc3c7'}
            onPress={openYosemite}
 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†title="Go to Yosemite üèî" />
          <Button
            color={'#bdc3c7'}
            onPress={openFacebookHQ}
 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†title="Go to Facebook HQ üïã" />
        );
```

## API
#### default function `open(options)`
`react-native-open-maps` immediately opens the map of the coordinates and the settings

#### `{ createOpenLink(options) }`
Creates a delayed invoked function to open the map. This is useful for binding functions to `onPress()` in a succinct manner. Think of it like ... `function openToMe() { open(coordinates) }`

#### `{ createMapLink(options) }`
Creates the raw link for the map.

| *mapType*    | `enum`: [`standard`, `satellite`, `hybrid`, `transit`] | Specifies base map type. Note, `hybrid` is the satellite map with a transit layer, where as `transit` is the standard roadmap with a `transit` layer. | "hybrid"                        | All, except Yandex does not support "hybrid"        |

**Note:** 
- Combining query with latitude and longitude will override the query parameter.
- Yandex Maps does not support building routes from current location.

### Map Actions
To perform certain map actions refer these necessary parameters
- **Setting Directions**: `end`,  [ *`start `*,  *`travelType`* ]
- **Display Map Around Coordinates:** `latitude` **+** `longitude`, [ *`zoom`* ]
- **Query Map For Location:** `query`

##### Query Property
The query behavior differs per platform:
- **Apple Maps**: If `latitude` and `longitude` is provided, this will place a marker with the `query` as a label. If no `latitude` or `longitude` is provided, it will center map to closest query match.
- **Google Maps**: Will override `latitude` and `longitude` if present and center map to closest query match. Without a `query`, you may however use `<latitude>,<longitude>` as a string value in the query to have a unnamed marker on the map.
- **Yandex Maps**: If `latitude` and `longitude` is provided, this will place a point to show the accurate location. If no `latitude` or `longitude` is provided, it will center map to closest query match.
